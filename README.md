# ðŸŒ¿ Plant Leaf Disease Detection using MATLAB

This project uses **MATLAB** and image processing techniques to detect and segment **diseased regions** in plant leaves automatically. The approach leverages the **Lab color space** and **K-Means clustering** for robust, unsupervised detection of disease-affected areas.

## ðŸ“Œ Features

- âœ… Automatic detection of diseased regions
- ðŸ§  Uses Lab color space (`a*`, `b*` channels) for color-based segmentation
- ðŸ¤– K-Means clustering for adaptive thresholding
- ðŸ§¼ Morphological operations for mask refinement
- ðŸ“Š Visual outputs for original image, segmented region, and analysis

---


## ðŸ§ª How It Works

1. User selects a diseased leaf image.
2. Convert image to **Lab color space** using `rgb2lab()`.
3. Extract `a*` and `b*` channels as features.
4. Reshape color data and apply **K-Means clustering** (`k = 2`).
5. Select the cluster with fewer pixels (assumed to be the diseased region).
6. Refine binary mask:
   - Median filtering
   - Hole filling
   - Noise removal
7. Apply the mask on the original image to isolate diseased area.
8. Display and save results.
